Source code will be released soon!

## Example Animations
The animated sequences (bottom row) are generated by transferring the motion extracted from the driving video (left) to the person in the source image (top row).

### VoxCeleb Dataset
The source images and driving videos are selected from the official VoxCeleb test set. We demonstrate both animation modes,  absolute and relative motion transfer, supported by our method.

#### Absolute Motion Transfer
